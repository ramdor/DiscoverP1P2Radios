# Discover Protocol 1 and Protocol 2 Radios

This lightweight tool scans all available network interfaces to locate Protocol 1 and Protocol 2 radios. It is particularly useful when you are unsure which IP addresses have been assigned to your radios.

Notes:
- Radios running original Apache Labs firmware (such as the 100D, 7000, or 8000) may show sequence (SEQ) errors when this tool is used while connected to Thetis.
- HermesLite2 radios will disappear from the list if they are already in use by another host (for example, Thetis), as they do not respond to discovery packets while busy.
- G2 radios are unaffected and will still respond even if Thetis is connected at the same time.
