# Discover Protocol 1 and Protocol 2 Radios

A small tool that attempts to find Protocol 1 and Protocol 2 radios on any available network interface. It is great to find radios that you are not sure what IP's have been allocated for example.

Note:
- original firmware radios from Apache Labs, such as 100D, 7000/8000 etc will exhibit sequence (SEQ) errors when running this tool if they are connected to Thetis
- HermesLite2 radios will drop from the list if they are connected to another host such as Thetis. They do not reply to the discovery packet when they are 'busy'
- G2 radios are not impacted if Thetis is connected to them and this tool is also running
